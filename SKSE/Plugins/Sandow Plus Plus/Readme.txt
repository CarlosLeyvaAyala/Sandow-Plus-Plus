Preset files are stored in this folder.
When first installed this mod, this folder is meant to be empty.

This folder was added as a safeguard because, depending on your Windows configuration, some programs are not allowed to create sub-folders inside some folders.
By adding this, preset saving won't fail if you have those specific Windows settings.
