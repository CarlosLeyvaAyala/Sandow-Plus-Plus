# About this folder
For version 4.0, all the logic for **this mod was moved to Lua** thanks to [JContainers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16495)!

That's awesome needs (for me, anyway), since using Lua means less boilerplate, more succint and expressive code and less hacks to deal with Papyrus' limitations.

Also, now I understand much better my own system and using Lua means I can't rewrite it to something more manageable, clean and expansive.\
V4.0 is almost a rewrite from scratch and it's way more bug free than before.


Take a good look around and bask in Lua's beautiness.
