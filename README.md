# Sandow-Plus-Plus
A mod for Skyrim SE. 
Gain weight (muscles) as you play.

You can find this mod at the [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32579) (***WARNING: NFSW pics***)

## Features
- Train and sleep to gain weight.
- Every time a certain skill goes up, you get `Weight Gain Potential (WGP)`, which transforms to weight when you sleep.
- Gaining and losing weight is controlled by your fatigue. If you go to sleep with little fatigue, you'll only grow a little. Get too much fatigue and you'll start to lose WGP and maybe even weight!
- Your gains can be affected by the law of diminishing returns: the more muscular you are, the harder is to get even more muscular (just like in real life). The opposite holds true. You can enable or disable this feature at will.
- Sleep however you want; just get enough of it. No penalties for badly timed or short sleeping sessions.
- Know your status without needing to open the MCM.
- Right off the bat, Alteration and Restoration give you some WGP, but you can make other schools of magic give you some if that's what you want.
- **Highly** configurable via MCM.
- Save and load up to three different presets with your own configuration settings.
- ESP flagged as ESL, so it only uses 1 slot out of 4096 instead of 1 out of 255. Save that precious space for bigger mods :)
- From version 2.0 and on, you can play with all the rules of [Pumping Iron](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13434) but with all the QOL mechanics introduced by Sandow Plus Plus.
