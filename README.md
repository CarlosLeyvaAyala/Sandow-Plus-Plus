# Sandow Plus Plus
A mod for Skyrim SE. 
Gain weight (muscles) as you play.

You can find this mod at the [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32579) (***WARNING: NFSW-ish pics***)

## Features
- Train and sleep to gain weight.
- Every time a certain skill goes up, you get `Weight Gain Potential (WGP)`, which transforms to weight when you sleep.
- Gaining and losing weight is controlled by your fatigue. If you go to sleep with little fatigue, you'll only grow a little. Get too much fatigue and you'll start to lose WGP and maybe even weight!
- Your gains can be affected by the law of diminishing returns: the more muscular you are, the harder is to get even more muscular (just like in real life). The opposite holds true. You can enable or disable this feature at will.
- Sleep however you want; just get enough of it. No penalties for badly timed or short sleeping sessions.
- Know your status without needing to open the MCM.
- Right off the bat, Alteration and Restoration give you some WGP, but you can make other schools of magic give you some if that's what you want.
- **Highly** configurable via MCM.
- Save and load up to three different presets with your own configuration settings.
- ESP flagged as ESL, so it only uses 1 slot out of 4096 instead of 1 out of 255. Save that precious space for bigger mods :)
- From version 2.0 and on, you can play with all the rules of [Pumping Iron](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13434) but with all the QOL mechanics introduced by Sandow Plus Plus.

## How to play
Go around doing your own business to earn `WGP` and just go to sleep when you are fatigued. That `WGP` gets converted to weight if conditions are right.

This mod is all about **fatigue managing**.
You'll only lose `WGP` if you go to sleep when your fatigue is above 90%. If your fatigue is 100% or above you'll also lose weight instead of gaining it (can be disabled in the MCM menu).

Weight gain is controlled by how much hours you sleep a day, but it's also controlled by fatigue. For best results, go to sleep 10 hours when you are somewhat fatigued (around 70% - 89.99%).
Sleeping more than 10 hours won't do anything for weight gaining, since your weight gain capabilities cap at 10 hours.
Of course, nothing stops you from sleeping 15 hours a day if it's more convenient to you. As I said, fatigue controls your gains, not time.

Always remember that **weight gaining depends on your WGP, how much you sleep and your fatigue**. You can certainly try to get cute and sleep 10 hours, wait 1 hour and then sleep again 10 hours, but you'll notice you won't gain as much as sleeping 10 straight hours when you are actually fatigued.

Fatigue builds two ways: over time and by leveling up skills.
Every single second awaken (in game time) you are getting fatigued. Also, each time you level up a skill that gives you WGP you get fatigued.
That means you'll get fatigued faster after a hard workout day compared to a shopping spree day.

And don't worry about performance. This mod only runs when you ask it to do it, and when it does, it's by performing simple mathematical formulas.
