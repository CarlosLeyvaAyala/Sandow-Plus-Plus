Overview for players
========================
* You become ripped by doing excercise and sleeping
	;TODO: when eating properly; ie. not too much, not too few).
* How fast you get ripped depends on how heavy you are; thinner players
get ripped faster.
* You lose muscle definition by inactivity and lack of sleep.
	Inactivity is worse than lack of sleep.
	;TODO: by over/under eating.
	The more you weight, the less harsh the penalty (because muscles give
	you some room to caloric expenditure IRL)
* You must workout every day.

For this behavior NiOverride (included in Racemenu) is required.

Overview for programmers
========================
You can see all the logic behind the formulas here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r10g-b73KjagmzT5Rm1SrWUY7ROhxtawBxy-vV4Yyms/edit?usp=sharing

* This behavior has a private variable that keeps track of the player's
total training points.
* Player's definition percent (alpha for the ripped texture set) is:
		alpha = training / ripped formula
* Ripped formulas
		p1 = (0, min)		p2 = (100, max)		shape = 0.02
		Where <min> and <max> are provided by the player (MCM).
* Player can only win a max of 1.0 training points when sleeping. Sleep
gains cap at 10 hours.
* Max Inactivity time = 24
* Penalties for lack of sleep
		When been awaken < 18 hrs				No penalty
		When been awaken => 18 but < 26			X-Small penalty
			awaken / 120
		When been awaken => 26					Small penalty
			awaken / 100		(caps at 1.2)
;@Functional:
* Penalties for inactivity
		p1 = (24, 0.5)		p2 = (96, 12)		shape = 0.04
* Weight penalty modifier
		p1 = (0, 1)			p2 = (100, 0.2)		shape = 0.02
* Widget bars
	1: Ripped texture set alpha
	2: WGP (caps at 1)
	3: Hours awaken / 26
	4: Inactivity / 24

Algorithms
========================
Behavior internal variables
		WGP					// Used to restore to this behavior WGP
		currentAlpha		// Needed for properly calculating diminishing returns

When entering this behavior
	Apply behavior texture set
	Save and clear CurrentState.WGP

When exiting this behavior
	if not bulker-cutter
		Set texture set alpha to 0
	else
		Tell the manager to apply the alpha calculated by this behavior
	Restore former CurrentState.WGP

Apply behavior texture set
	Tell the texture set manager to apply the ripped texture set
	if the manager could apply it
		Tell the manager to apply the alpha calculated by this behavior

When sleeping
	;@Functional:
	Calculate training and WGP
	Tell the manager to apply the alpha calculated by this behavior

Calculate gains
	CurrentState.WGP = Min(1.0, CurrentState.WGP)
	training for today = CurrentState.WGP * Capped sleeping time * 0.1 * diminishingReturns(currentAlpha)
	CurrentState.WGP -= training for today
	training += training for today

Calculate alpha
	a = (cfg.maxDays - cfg.minDays) / (e^(100b) - 1)
	b = 0.02
	c = min - a
	maxDays = a * e^(b * weight) + c. 			// Where 0 <= weight <= 100.
	currentAlpha = training / maxDays
	return currentAlpha

Calculate loses
	By inactivity
	By sleep
	;TODO: not eating properly
	multiply loses by weight factor
	training -= loses

Calculate training
	if can lose
		Calculate loses
	else
		Calculate gains
