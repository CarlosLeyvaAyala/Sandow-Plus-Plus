========================
Overview for players
========================
* You become ripped by doing excercise and sleeping (TODO: when
eating properly; ie. not too much, not too few).
* How fast you get ripped depends on how heavy you are; thinner players
get ripped faster.
* You lose muscle definition by inactivity and lack of sleep (TODO:
by over/under eating). Inactivity is worse than lack of sleep.
	The more you weight, the less harsh the penalty (because muscles give
	you some room to caloric expenditure IRL)
* You must workout every day.

For this behavior NiOverride (included in Racemenu) is required.

========================
Overview for programmers
========================
* This behavior has a private variable that keeps track of the player's
total training points.
* Player's definition percent (alpha for the ripped texture set) is:
		alpha = training / ripped formula
* Ripped formulas
		Original (first approach. "Realistic")
			(12.5 * e^(0.037 * Weight) + 30) / 1.25

		Simplified original (not exactly the same as original,
		but close enough)
			10 * e^(0.037 * Weight) + 25

		Fun 1 (first approach. Game feasible)
			3.2 * e^(0.037 * Weight) + 22

		Fun 2 (probably best game feasible formula)
			32 * e^(0.015 * Weight) - 5

* Player can only win a max of 1.0 training points when sleeping. Sleep
gains cap at 10 hours.
* Max Inactivity time = 24
* Penalties for lack of sleep
		When been awaken < 18 hrs				No penalty
		When been awaken => 18 but < 26			X-Small penalty
			awaken / 120
		When been awaken => 26					Small penalty
			awaken / 100		(caps at 1.2)
* Penalties for inactivity
		When inactive >= 24 hrs					Exponential penalty
			0.108 * e^(0.052 * inactivity) + 0.15		cap at 16
* Weight penalty modifier
		-0.2 * e^(0.0153 * weight) + 0.122

Algoritms
========================
When entering this behavior
	Apply behavior texture set
	Clear CurrentState.WGP

When exiting this behavior
	Set texture set alpha to 0
	Restore former WGP

Apply behavior texture set
	Tell the texture set manager to apply the ripped texture set
	if the manager could apply it
		Tell the manager to apply the alpha calculated by this behavior

When sleeping
	Calculate gains or loses
	Tell the manager to apply the alpha calculated by this behavior

Calculate gains
	CurrentState.WGP = Min(1.0, CurrentState.WGP)
	training for today = CurrentState.WGP * Capped sleeping time * 0.1
	CurrentState.WGP -= training for today
	training += training for today

Calculate alpha
	Long as hell formula (realistic one) ->  12.5 * e^(0.037 * Weight) + 30
